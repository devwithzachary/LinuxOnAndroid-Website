The Complete (GNU) Linux Installer for Android devices.

## About

The LinuxOnAndroid project has been around now for over 10 years in some form or another.
It all started with a simple set of bash scripts designed to be run in a terminal emulator and bootstrap an Ubuntu environment.
Over the years the project grow and grow into the Complete Linux Install, an Android app designed to automate that bootstrap and setup process.

Fast forward to 2021 and project has been reignite by its orignial lead developer Zachary Powell as a fully open source project hosted on github.

## The (NEW) Complete Linux Install Android app

Thanks to advances in [Proot](https://proot-me.github.io/) it is no longer a requirement to root your Android device to create a chroot enviroment.
Because of this the new version of the app currently in development will no longer require root at all!
